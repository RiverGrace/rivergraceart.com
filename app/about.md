At my core, I am a person who is terrified of forgetting. 

I spend most of my time noticing the small details of my day-to-day life in an attempt to combat this fear. I note the spring buds swelling on the tree outside my apartment to memorize details about the species and compare to last year. I collect and press leaves to remember a walks with a close friends. I fill journals with these small observations alongside poems and ticket stubs and maps. I'm a digital hoarder as well; 15 years of organized photos, detailed spreadsheets of all my first dates, and a Google map of places I've cried, to name a few. 

This site is a public repository for all the tiny observations, poems, collections of ephemera, leaf art, and photography I want to preserve and share. Through this sharing, I hope to create an intimacy that highlights our interdependence and shared experiences.
